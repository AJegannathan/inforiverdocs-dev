# Smart Analysis

You can create a column to do analysis of each row value compared to a base value.

You can insert two types of Smart analysis columns:

- **Variance** – Difference between base value (row selected) and each record
- **Contribution** – Percentage of each record to the base value

To insert the smart analysis column,

- Select the cell to be used as the base value.
- Select **Insert** Tab from the toolbar, and select **Smart Analysis** from the **Cells** ribbon bar category.
- Select **Contribution** from the drop down.
- The % Contribution column is inserted into the visual.
