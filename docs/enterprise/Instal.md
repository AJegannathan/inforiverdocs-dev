# Inforiver On-Premise Installation Guide

*This document details installation and configuration steps for Inforiver Enterprise (On-Premise).*

## Introduction

Inforiver is a custom visual that extends Microsoft‚Äôs Power BI reporting tool. Specifically, Inforiver adds the ability to produce dense, information rich reports, which users can easily collaborate upon and share with others.

![Example Inforiver Report](/img/Instal/Instal1.png)
Example Inforiver Report

In this document, you‚Äôll learn how to install the on-premises version of Inforiver Enterprise. This on-premises version gives you complete control over how and where your data is stored. This means that all the Inforiver services are running in your environment in the Azure Cloud. It also means that the only outbound network calls are either to Microsoft services or the Inforiver licensing service. This will satisfy your organization‚Äôs strict data security, data governance and data residency policy, because the software runs entirely in your environment.

## Prerequisite:

Azure is the only cloud cloud platform we currently support for on-premises edition. Other cloud providers like AWS, GCP are currently unsupported. We might add support to these platforms in future. Please feel free to contact our support team to get more information.

### Platform Requirements:

1. **Azure Subscription**: An existing Azure subscription in which you would deploy our solution.
2. **New Azure Resource Group**: A new resource group would be needed to deploy the solution.
3. **Azure CLI Access**: To configure few steps after deployment, you need to have a working Azure CLI.
4. **Azure AD Application:** Inforiver will use multiple Office 365 APIs to fetch relevant information like Power BI Report metadata, User emails and groups, SharePoint and OneDrive integration. For this Azure AD application, steps needs to be created in your tenant by following the steps mentioned below. The details would be needed from app while we deploy our application.
    - **To Create an Azure AD App**
        
        Creation Steps

## Architecture and Components:

### Architecture Design:

Below is an ideal architecture diagram that can be configured up to organizational standards. The bare minimal deployment architecture can be found at the bottom of this section.

![Fig 2: Network Architecture](/img/Instal/Instal10.png)

Fig 2: Network Architecture

### Architecture Description:

Following are the components that are mentioned in the architecture above.

<aside>
üí° Please note that all the components won‚Äôt be installed. We will only deploy the required components and others are optional or external.

</aside>

### Core Components

Only the following components will get created and configured in your Resource Group when you are deploying by using the marketplace app.

1. **Azure Web App Service and Plan:** API Server. This service handles all the APIs triggered from the visual or Add-on App. This contains all the business logic and acts as a back-end service and route handler to serve static files like HTML, JS, CSS, and all images for the Inforiver Add-On.
2. **Azure Kubernetes Service and its dependent Resource Group:** With this service, applications are quickly brought up on the cloud. This means no lock-in to a single vendor or system. To support applications that have different compute or storage demands, a user needs to create additional node pools. User node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting your application pods.
3. **Azure SQL Server and Database:** It's a fully managed database-as-a-service that can handle mission-critical workloads with predictable performance, security, high availability, and dynamic scalability. Users can create highly scalable applications with complex security.
4. **Azure Cache for Redis:** It serves both for caching and queue for our background worker jobs.
5. **Azure Blob Storage:** It stores the static files which are uploaded or created from the Inforiver application.
6. **Virtual Network and Subnets:** It provides IP based communication options to the deployed resources. The subnets are classified in terms or traffic segregation.
7. **Private Links and Private Endpoints:** Private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from a virtual network. This network interface connects privately and securely to a service that's powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, the service into your virtual network can be obtained.

### External Dependencies

1. **Azure Container Registry (External):** All application code would be compiled and stored in this centralized registry from where each component will pull its code.
2. **Licensing Service (External):** This service will help Inforiver to identify your license information and the features available to you. This will exchange only your license information.
3. **Power BI Service (External):** Power BI Service in which the Inforiver visual would be running. 
4. **Azure Active Directory Service (External)**: This service would help us to fetch information from your O365.
5. **SMTP Service (External):** This service will help us to send email from Inforiver.

### Optional Components

1. **Application Gateway (Optional)**: Application Gateway connects web applications to the cloud. It provides a web interface so that users can monitor traffic usage.
2. **Application Insights (Optional):** Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that provides extensible application performance management (APM) and monitoring for live web apps.
3. **Azure Key Vault (Optional):** It¬†helps teams to securely store and manage sensitive information such as keys, passwords, and certificates in centralized storage with industry-standard algorithms, it even has fine granular control for permissions over sensitive data.
