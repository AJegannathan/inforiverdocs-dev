## Writeback in Read Mode

When users want to perform writeback from the reading view of the report for data consolidation/capture, follow the below steps.  Inforiver Writeback configuration for Reading Mode involves a few additional steps apart from setting up Destination.

**Configure Writeback destination:**

1. Select a database destination type that supports DirectQuery Mode in Power BI. At present, we recommend using the Azure SQL database for performing Writeback in reading mode.
    1. ~~While you are creating a destination, you will see a checkbox ‚Äú***Enable Collaboration***‚Äù and you have to enable that checkbox.~~
2. ~~Enable this checkbox and save your destination. This will create a new table ‚Äú*yourtablename*_collaboration‚Äù (can be edited) which will be your data source for Writeback in read mode.~~

![Fig W 4.1](Writeback%205461f2a7e4ee411292a9ac811838b549/Untitled%2011.png)

Fig W 4.1

**Creating Series & Initial Writeback:**

1. ~~Go to Power BI, open Writeback settings and under Collaboration, you need to create a new series for each column. Do not create series for all the columns together. You need to select one series at a time and perform below steps before creating another series.~~
2. ~~Now, add the collaboration table within your Power BI report in DirectQuery mode. Add relationships from your dimension tables to this collaboration table.~~
3. ~~Once the series is created, you need to refresh the Power BI dataset and the newly created series will appear under the collaboration table.~~
4. ~~Once the new data source is added, the next step is to replace the columns that are already on the report visual with the columns coming through the Collaboration table in DirectQuery mode.~~

![Fig W 4.2](Writeback%205461f2a7e4ee411292a9ac811838b549/Untitled%2012.png)

Fig W 4.2

1. ~~Perform the Writeback and once it is done, the collaboration table holds the dataset that users have on the report currently. Also, the series that you created will persist now in database.~~
2. ~~Repeat the same steps (1-5) if you have additional columns.~~

**Enable the Series for Writeback in Read mode:**

1. Now, navigate to Writeback settings, and under the Collaboration tab, choose the series that needs to be enabled for Writeback in reading mode.
2. Publish the report to Power BI Service.
3. Now, if users open the same report using Power BI Service, there is a possibility that you may face a Gateway error. Users need to navigate to the Settings section of the Dataset and add the required gateways.
4. As we are all set now, users who have access to this report, need to sign in to inforiver visual and would be able to edit the data in reading mode successfully by double-clicking on a cell.
5. Once the data is edited, you can navigate to the Export tab and click on the Writeback icon to perform the operation in Full Mode or click on the Save button in Minimal mode.

## Troubleshooting

1. If the user is not a part of the Workspace or Tenant then that user will not be able to log in - Users should get connected with Admin for the resolution

1. In the Read Mode: If users need other visuals to refresh on data update, they can set up the page refresh on the report and select refresh mode as change detection based on the IR_Timestamp column for the desired refresh interval (say 5-10 secs)
