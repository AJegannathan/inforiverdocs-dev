## Writeback in Read Mode

When users want to perform writeback from the reading view of the report for data consolidation/capture, follow the below steps.  Inforiver Writeback configuration for Reading Mode involves a few additional steps apart from setting up Destination.

**Configure Writeback destination:**

1. Select a database destination type that supports DirectQuery Mode in Power BI. At present, we recommend using the Azure SQL database for performing Writeback in reading mode.
2. When creating the scenario if owner has given access in the reading mode then user can perform writeback in reading mode also.
    
    ![Untitled](/img/Enterprise/Writeback/Write22.png)
    
    1. In Reading mode user can add

**Enable the Series for Writeback in Read mode:**

1. Now, navigate to Writeback settings, and under the Collaboration tab, choose the series that needs to be enabled for Writeback in reading mode.
2. Publish the report to Power BI Service.
3. Now, if users open the same report using Power BI Service, there is a possibility that you may face a Gateway error. Users need to navigate to the Settings section of the Dataset and add the required gateways.
4. As we are all set now, users who have access to this report, need to sign in to inforiver visual and would be able to edit the data in reading mode successfully by double-clicking on a cell.
5. Once the data is edited, you can navigate to the Export tab and click on the Writeback icon to perform the operation in Full Mode or click on the Save button in Minimal mode.

## Troubleshooting
