Report+ generates 3 types of views for your data. Summary view, List view and Compare view. Below is given details about all the views.

### List View

List views are simply lists of records with the same object type. You will see a list of accounts when you click on the plan tab. Unlike spreadsheets, reports provide analytical snapshots of your business. Record segments can be quickly segmented and then acted upon using a list view. You can view all the available labels in the breadcrumbs.

- Click on Compare view tab on the top right corner of the table
- Select the labels from both reports for comparison.
- You can select the category from the drop-down filter for comparison in compare view

### Special Feature

The special feature of per-page scaling is available in report+

Regardless of how many pages there are or whether charts are used in the columns, the report will look the same on every page. This is because chart widths are determined by the maximum and minimum values on each page, an amazing feature supported by inforiver.

For Example - You are creating a report with Employee salary if values are not equally distributed in the column, inline charts may show variation. In Inforiver Report+ per page scaling is done which reduces the dissimilarity and beautified the report with per page scaling. zqqew
