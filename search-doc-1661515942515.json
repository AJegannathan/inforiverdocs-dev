Default template: comes with pre-formatted alternating row colors and table borders, similar to the PowerBI native visual. Spreadsheet template: has gridlines for all the rows and as the name suggests it gives the feel of a spreadsheet. Finance: Under Finance, there are two options available Simple and Standard. Finance template: is generally used to build financial reports like income statements, balance sheets, etc. Simple Template comes with no borders and bold formatting for the totals/subtotals. Standard Finance Template comes with formatting options like Prefix $, brackets for negative numbers. International Business Communication Standard (IBCS) compliant templates: The International Business Communication Standards (IBCS®) are practical proposals for the design of reports and dashboards. These templates can be used to create IBCS compliant reports. T01 - TABLE WITH HIERARCHICAL ROWS AND VARIANCE COLUMNS: Table template 01 presents one measure (Profit after tax) with rows showing a regional structure and columns showing absolute and relative variances to the previous year and plan. T02 TABLE WITH HIERARCHICAL ROWS AND INTEGRATED BAR CHARTS: In this, table template the figure columns of absolute and relative variances are replaced by bars and pins. T03: TABLE WITH MEASURE ROWS: Table template 03 shows a calculation scheme in the rows. T04: TABLE WITH MEASURE ROWS AND INTEGRATED WATERFALLS: In this table template the pure figure columns of absolute and relative variances are replaced by waterfall bars and pins. This Table with Variance Charts, it shows Hierarchical Data with Absolute Variance as Bar and Relative Variance as Pins for months and year-to-date.  **T05:** **MULTI-TIER BAR CHARTS:** The first tier of this template compares different scenarios in a grouped bar chart. The second and third tiers show different absolute and relative variance charts.
